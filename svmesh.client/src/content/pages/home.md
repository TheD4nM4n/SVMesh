## What is a mesh?

A mesh is a decentralized network of devices that communicate with each other directly, rather than relying on a central hub or internet connection. This allows for greater resilience, as the network can adapt and reroute data even if some nodes go offline. We use low-power, long-range radio boards to create these connections, enabling devices to communicate over distances that traditional Wi-Fi or Bluetooth cannot cover. We currently utilize the Meshtastic open-source project to power our mesh network, which requires no amateur radio license.

## What can it be used for?

As a community, the mesh is not used for much more than saying hello. And say hello we do, as we do daily check-ins at 9pm. However, private use cases have popped up in the mesh space, including low-power position tracking, backup emergency communications, and for reading sensor data remotely. While Meshtastic is NOT a replacement for emergency communication, it can be used as a backup for a more reliable means of communication like amateur radio. Above all, it is a fun platform for the community to tinker with in their own ways, whether it be infrastructure, CAD design, or software development.

## How do I get started?

To get started, you will need a node. These can be bought pre-built or built yourself using readily available boards. Consult our [getting started guide](/getting-started) before your make your purchase for some good options in both categories, and for help getting connected to the mesh for the first time.

## I want to join the community!

We're glad to have you! We primarily operate on Discord and Facebook, come join us to talk all things mesh. Our community is filled with people who can help you on your path to getting online for the first time! Joining will also help you stay in the know about community events, mesh related issues or updates, and more. Come on in!
