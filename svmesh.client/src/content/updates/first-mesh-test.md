# First Mesh Network Test

Yesterday we conducted our first successful test of the mesh network infrastructure across the Susquehanna Valley.

## Test Results

- **Range**: Successfully established connections up to 15 miles
- **Nodes**: 8 active nodes participated in the test
- **Message Delivery**: 98% success rate for message routing
- **Battery Life**: Solar-powered nodes maintained operation for 48+ hours

## Next Steps

We're planning to expand the network with additional nodes in key locations to improve coverage and redundancy.
